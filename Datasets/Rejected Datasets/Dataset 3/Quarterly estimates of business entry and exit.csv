1,"For quarterly estimates, microdata from the employer deduction remittance account (PD7) are used to allocate entry and exit of firms to the quarter in which they occur.  Entry and exit are defined based on calendar years. These definitions are consistent with those of entry and exit from the Longitudinal Employment Analysis Program (LEAP). Entries are enterprises with no employment in the previous year and with positive employment for the first time in the listed quarter of the current year. Exits are enterprises with no employment in the future year and with employment for the last time in the listed quarter of the current year. Exits in the last two years are projected using data on business closings and entries. A closing is a business with employment in the current quarter and no employment in the future quarter."
2,"There is a difference in the way data are reported in the Longitudinal Employment Analysis Program (LEAP) and the quarterly estimates. This difference affects comparisons between LEAP and the quarterly estimates. In LEAP and in the quarterly entry and exit program, entry, exit and incumbent status are determined based on year-pairs, such as 2014/2015. The LEAP table 33-10-0164-01 reports entry and exit for the year-pairs as occurring in the final year of each pair. In the quarterly estimates, entrants and entrant rates are reported as occurring in the final year of each year-pair while exits and exit rates are reported as occurring in the initial year of each year-pair. This long-standing difference means that the number of exits and the exit rate reported in the LEAP (table 33-10-0164-01) for year t correspond to the number of exits and the exit rate from the quarterly data for year t-1. The entry data coincide."
3,"The private sector covers all industrial sectors except educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration."
4,"All quarterly estimates have been annualized. The average for the four quarters of a given year is equal to the annual estimate. All counts have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 10."
5,"The entry (exit) rate is obtained by dividing the number of entries (exits) by the average total number of enterprises in the previous and current quarters."
6,"The employment creation (destruction) rate by entries (exits) is obtained by dividing the employment associated with entries (exits) by the average total employment in the previous and current quarters."
