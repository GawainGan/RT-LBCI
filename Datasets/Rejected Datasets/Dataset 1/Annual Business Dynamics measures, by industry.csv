Footnotes:
1,"A business entity corresponds to the operations of an employer enterprise in a given province/territory. For example, an enterprise at the national level that has employees in two provinces/territories is counted as two business entities here. This provincial definition, which is used in tables 527-0007 to 527-0012, is different from the one used in the national-level tables 527-0001 to 527-0006 (every employer enterprise represents only one business entity)."
2,"Employer businesses include both incorporated and unincorporated businesses that issue one or more statements of remuneration paid (T4 slip(s)) to their employee(s) for tax purposes."
3,"All numbers in this table are rounded to units of ten. Therefore, the private sector total does not necessarily equate to the sum of individual categories."
4,"Due to variations in business structure over time, counts are not additive across years. For example, the number of active businesses in 2012 is not exactly equal to the number of active businesses in 2011 plus the number of entries in 2012 minus the number of exits in 2012. The difference observed is typically less than 1.0%."
5,"Every business belongs to one of the following three employment dynamics categories: entrants, businesses with employees in the current year but none in the previous year; incumbents, businesses with employees in both the current and previous years; and exits, businesses with employees in the previous year but none in the current year. In the above table, the category `active employer businesses' is defined as the sum of incumbents and entrants."
6,"The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 1997 is used for reference year 2001, NAICS 2002 is used for reference years 2002 to 2006, NAICS 2007 is used for reference years 2007 to 2011, and NAICS 2012 is used for reference years starting in 2012."
7,"The private sector covers all industrial sectors except utilities, educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration. It includes unclassified businesses."
8,"Unclassified businesses are those for which the industrial classification has yet to be determined."
9,"The denominator used in the calculation of the entry and exit rates is the average number of active businesses in the previous and current years."
