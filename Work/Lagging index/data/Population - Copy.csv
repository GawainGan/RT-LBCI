Footnotes:
1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality."
2,"An economic region is a geographical unit generally composed of several census divisions within a province. While 73 regions are defined for the purposes of sampling, some areas are too small to enable production of independent estimates from the survey. These small regions are grouped with a neighbouring region with similar economic characteristics. In the case of Prince Edward Island, the province constitutes one economic region. For geographic descriptions of economic regions, refer to the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (catalogue number 71-543-GIE)."
3,"Excluding the territories."
4,"Number of persons of working age, 15 years and over. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred."
